    st.write("Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for. Someone that you connect with, who you think you will be friends forever. Not necessarily someone you see or talk to every day; often someone you may not see all the time, but you just pick up where you left off. Someone who knows you and whom you know and you just accept each other when you need to. You may have lots of friends throughout your life but will probably have very few lifelong friends. They are the keeper of my secrets and can often know how we're feeling before we say a single. Someone who's enjoys trying new things and exploring new places. Truly special and outstanding. They are someone I admire and appreciate deeply. Someone who makes me laugh and brings joy into my life. They have a great sense a humor and can lighten up any situation. They are thankful for the people and experiences that make life worth living. Someone who has a strong connection with me that goes beyond just being friends. They make me feel like family or siblings and share a special bond. They are truly a gift!")
